# FGA-DIKU
A GitHub organization of the [Fine Grained Analysis Collaboratory](https://www.aicentre.dk/collaboratories/fine-grained-analysis) at the Pioneer Centre for AI.

Our website can be found [here](https://fga-diku.github.io/) but is currently under construction.

<!--
**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
üåà Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
üë©‚Äçüíª Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
üçø Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
üßô Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
